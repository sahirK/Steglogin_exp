This paper provides a scheme where the security algorithms of steganography would provide a very high level of security when applied over the web authentication. The usage of  image processing  algorithms  would  provide  a very high  security as  compared  to  the  existing methodologies. Application of Steganography would  also be substitute to the biometric  and RFID tokens.  The authors  provide a  procedure through which several  web attacks can be controlled  as brute-force  attack, dictionary  attack, and  password  guessing  which would make the web applications immune from various hackers.
